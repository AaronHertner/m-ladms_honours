# Machine Learning Assisted Dynamic Musical Synthesis (M-LADMS)  
  
  This project uses JupyterLabs, sklearn, python, pickle, TKinter, and FLStudio to create a GUI that users can interact with that will create music based on various selections.

 The project will
 1. pull data from the database
 2. train models using the pulled/cleaned data
 3. the model will be exported as a pickle file for portability
 4. lastly, the information will be pulled from the GUI and given to the synthesis tool/model to generate a short music track
